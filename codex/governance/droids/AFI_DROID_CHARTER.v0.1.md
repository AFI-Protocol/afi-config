# AFI Droid Charter v0.1

Status: v0.1 — initial charter (subject to future revision)
Scope: Factory droids and automated agents operating across AFI Protocol repositories
Location: `afi-config/codex/governance/droids/AFI_DROID_CHARTER.v0.1.md`

## Purpose

This document defines the core constraints, expectations, and safety rules for **Factory droids** and other automated agents operating within the AFI Protocol ecosystem.

It is the **canonical, governance-level policy** that droids must follow when:
- editing schemas and Codex metadata,
- modifying DAG or pipeline configuration,
- touching token/emissions logic,
- or making any change that affects protocol behavior.

## TODO (for humans)

- Flesh out the exact droid responsibilities and prohibitions.
- Add versioning and amendment procedures.
- Define how violations are detected and handled.
- Describe the relationship between this Charter, AOS, and AFI Codex.

Until this section is fully authored, droids should treat this file as:
- a **binding reference**,
- but defer to `AGENTS.md` and local repo doctrine files where more specific.
