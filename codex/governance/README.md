# AFI Codex Governance (afi-config)

This directory contains **governance-level policies** for the AFI Protocol ecosystem.

Governance documents define **rules of the system**, not just configuration values. They are:

- Human-readable (Markdown),
- Versioned explicitly (e.g., `.v1.md`, `.v2.md`),
- Canonical sources of policy for AFI agents and droids.

## Current Governance Artifacts

### Droids

- **AFI Droid Charter v0.1**
  Path: `droids/AFI_DROID_CHARTER.v0.1.md`
  Defines how Factory droids and automated agents are expected to operate across AFI repositories.

Future governance domains (agents, validators, emissions, signals, etc.) may be added alongside droids in this directory.
